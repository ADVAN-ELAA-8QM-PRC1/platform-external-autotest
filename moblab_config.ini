[AUTOSERV]
# Minimum OS version that supports server side packaging. Older builds may
# not have server side package built or with Autotest code change to support
# server-side packaging.
# This build is older than the one used in global config (6986). This allows
# moblab can still test builds in R43 branch with server-side packaging, except
# that with it can't run paygen_au_canary and moblab_RunSuite suites.
