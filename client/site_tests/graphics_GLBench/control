Various performance metrics must be met or exceeded or the test will fail. See

This benchmark executes glbench, a graphics benchmark designed to time how long
various graphic intensive activities take, which includes measuring:
  - fill rate
    - blended
    - opaque
  -Z reject rate
  -triangle rate
    - no cull
    - half cull (half triangles backface culled)
    - full cull (mix of back face and degenerates)
  - blend rate
  - texture fetch
    - nearest
    - bilinear
    - trilinear
  - compute
    - vertex shader
    - pixel shader
    - *fragement shader to test ddx and ddy
  - attribute fetch
  - color depth stencil test
  - *state change
  - texture upload
  - read back

* Not yet implemented.
