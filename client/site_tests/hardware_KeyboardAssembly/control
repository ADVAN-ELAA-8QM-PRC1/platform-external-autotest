This test checks whether all keyboard keys function properly.  This
test will display a keyboard image and keys will be highlighted as
they are pressed and released. Once all keys have been used, a brief
'PASS' message will be displayed and the test will terminate.  After
the first key is hit, a countdown will begin.  If not all keys are
used in time, the test will fail with an 'ERROR' message that is
displayed forever (unless the 'hwqual' argument is passed in).
