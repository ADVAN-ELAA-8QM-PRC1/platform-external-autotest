This test uses FIO to spawn a number of threads to perform a particular type of
I/O. This test will do data integrity checks by first running a workload that
writes data to the spare root partition and then verifying, after 72 hours,
that the data on storage is still valid.

NOTE: If autoupdate or another program accesses the spare root partition
while this test is running, corruption may occur.
