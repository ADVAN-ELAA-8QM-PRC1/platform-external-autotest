  Tests that we can complete OpenVPN authentication.  This is a client-only
  test which verifies function of the OpenVPN client.  Since the server it
  is testing against is itself, this test is best suited for verifying that
  the connection manager is correctly passing parameters to the underlying
  VPN client to have it properly connect.
