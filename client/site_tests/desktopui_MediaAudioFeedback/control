Test that the sound from media files can be heard by recording from mic in.
Each audio channel is tested independently and currently there is no accurate
comparison with the input data. Instead the test passes when
a) the silent signal is sufficiently weak and (TODO: rohitbm@chromium.org)
b) the captured audio from each media replay is sufficiently loud.

NOTE: For this test to pass you need to have the line out looped back to mic-in.
This can be through a 3.5mm male-to-male cable or a loopback dongle depending on
your device.
