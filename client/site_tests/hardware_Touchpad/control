This test checks whether all touchpad functions work properly.  This
test will display a touchpad image and features will be highlighted in some
way as they are used. Once all features have been used, a brief 'PASS'
message will be displayed and the test will terminate.  After the first
feature is used, a countdown will begin.  If not all features are
used in time, the test will fail with an 'ERROR' message that is
displayed forever (unless the 'hwqual' argument is passed in).
