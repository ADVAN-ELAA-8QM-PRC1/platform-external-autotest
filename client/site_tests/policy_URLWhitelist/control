Verify effects of policy_URLWhitelist policy on client behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the URLWhitelist user policy on Chrome OS
client behavior. It exercises a range of policy values using three unique test
cases, named: NotSet_Blocked, SinglePage_Allowed and MultiplePages_Allowed.
See the test file for a full description of what each test case does.

The test case shall pass if:
 - Only URLs that in the URLWhitelist policy value are allowed.
 - All other URLs are blocked.
The test case shall fail if the above behavior is not enforced.
