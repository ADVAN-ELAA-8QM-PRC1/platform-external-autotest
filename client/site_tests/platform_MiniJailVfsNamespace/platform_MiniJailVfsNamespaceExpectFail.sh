# This script runs two processes to check the mount visibility.  On start, the
# first process waits for the MOUNT command on stdin.  Upon receiving the
# command, it will mount $MOUNT_FROM to $MOUNT_TO as a bind mount, and then
# create the file named $MOUNT_TO/$FILE_TO_TEST.  The second process waits the
# command CHECK on stdin, and upon receipt, it checks to see if it can open
# $MOUNT_TO/$FILE_TO_TEST and reports success or failure.  UMOUNT is sent to the
# first process, which then deletes the file and removes the mount.
# Finally, both processes are sent the EXIT command on stdin.

# In this test, the mount is done outside of minijail, so the checking process
# should have no problem seeing the created file.
