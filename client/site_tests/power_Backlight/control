This test verifies that the following properties about the backlight:
  1) The backlight can be adjusted in software using
     the /sys/class/backlight interface
  2) The backlight must support at least five distinct levels.
  3) As you turn up the backlight from 0% -> 25% -> 50% -> 75% -> 100%,
     each successive bump uses more energy than the previous level.
