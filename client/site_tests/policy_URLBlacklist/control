Verify effects of policy_URLBlacklist policy on client behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the URLBlacklist user policy on Chrome OS
client behavior. It exercises a range of policy values using three unique test
cases, named: NotSet_Allowed, SinglePage_Blocked and MultiplePages_Blocked.
See the test file for a full description of what each test case does.

A test case shall pass if the URLs that are not in the URLBlacklist policy
value are allowed. The test case shall also pass if the URLs that are in
the URLBlacklist policy value are blocked. A test case shall fail if the above
behavior is not enforced.
