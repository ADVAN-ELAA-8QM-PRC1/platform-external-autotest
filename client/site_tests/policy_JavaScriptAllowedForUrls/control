Verify effects of JavaScriptAllowedForUrls policy on client behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the JavaScriptAllowedForUrls user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior when the DefaultJavaScriptSetting user policy is set
to 2. It exercises a range of policy values using four unique test cases:
NotSet_Block, SingleUrl_Allow, MultipleUrls_Block, and MultipleUrls_Allow.
See the test file for a full description of what each test case does.

In general, a test shall pass if the browser allows JavaScript to execute only
on a test page with a URL that matches one or more of the URL patterns listed
in JavaScriptBlockedForUrls. A test shall fail if the browser blocks execution
on a page where it should be allowed, or allows execution on a page where it
should be blocked.
