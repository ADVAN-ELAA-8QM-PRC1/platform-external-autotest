Verify effects of PopupsAllowedForUrls policy on client look and feel.

This test verifies the effect of the PopupsAllowedForUrls user policy on
Chrome OS client behavior and appearance when the DefaultPopupsSetting policy
is set to 2. It exercises a range of policy values using four unique test
cases, named: NotSet, 1Url, 2Urls, and 3Urls. See the test file for a full
description of what each test case does.

In general, a test shall pass if the browser only allows images to be shown
on a test page that is in a domain listed in the PopupsAllowedForUrls policy.
A test shall fail if the browser blocks images on a page where they should be
allowed to be shown, or allows images to be shown on a page where they should
be blocked.

Usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> PopupsAllowedForUrls

Runs all the test cases against a device with the specified IP address, using
the DM Test environment with the given DM Server name, and signing in to the
device with the given username and password.
