This is a semi-automated test that displays vertical lines scrolling
horizontally and asks the user if tearing was observed.  Three variants are
available:
  * using uniform update.  This tests that glSwapInterval function performs as
    expected.
  * using full texture update.  This tests that CPU-GPU interaction is properly
    synchronized in the driver.
  * using pixmap to texture extension.  This tests that pixmap to texture
    extension is properly synchronized.
