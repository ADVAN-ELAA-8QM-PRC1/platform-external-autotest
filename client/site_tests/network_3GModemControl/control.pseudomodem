  Tests that commands sent to ModemManager1 are reflected in shill.

  Issues many connect, disconnect, enable, and disable commands to
  ensure that the modem state is always properly reflected in shill --
  even if the commands are sent to the modem manager instead of shill.
  Uses a pseudo modem to simulate modem manager so that this test can
  be run on a virtual machine.
