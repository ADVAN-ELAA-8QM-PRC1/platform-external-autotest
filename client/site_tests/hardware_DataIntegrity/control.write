This is part of data correctness and retention testing.

This test writes data in native block-size (usually 512B) blocks to be later
verified by a read test.
For a 2GiB partition, this test will perform 4194304 writes.
The subsequent verification should be performed with matching options, but
with the -w (write-only) option replaced by -r (read-only) option.
