This test runs a load test consisting of cycling though web pages, playing
videos, etc. and measures battery power draw.

The following manual steps need to be performed on the device under test
before this test can be run:
1. make sure that Ethernet cable is disconnected and WiFi is connected
2. login to Chrome OS and open a terminal window (Ctrl-Alt-t)
3. run the following command to launch a new browser window:
   sudo su chronos -c "/opt/google/chrome/chrome --no-first-run"
4. in the newly opened browser window:
4.1. navigate to http://www.gmail.com. Logout if already logged in. Check the
     "Stay signed in" box and log in. If the yellow "Do you want Chromium to
     save password" bar comes up, click on "Save password"
