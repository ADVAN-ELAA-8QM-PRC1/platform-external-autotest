This test runs a load test consisting of cycling though web pages, playing
videos, etc. and measures battery power draw. The duration of this test is
determined by the seconds variable.


The following manual steps need to be performed on the device under test
before this test can be run:
  - make sure that Ethernet cable is disconnected and WiFi is connected
  - disconnect power cable

You are now ready to run the test.

# To specify a list of custom tasks, pass in the task parameter:
#    tasks='<task00>&<task01>+<task10>&<task11>+<task20>&<task21>+...'
#
# Use '+' to link together tasks sequentially, and '&' to indicate tasks that
# should be run in parallel.

# Task format:
# - Open a window with some tabs, keep them open for some time:
#       window;<comma-delimited urls>;<duration>
# - Cycle through a list of sites one at a time, for a total duration, and a
#   given delay on each site.
#       cycle;<comma-delimited urls>;<duration>;<delay>
#
# Duration and delay are given in seconds.  With sequential tasks, if
# task0.duration=1800 and task1.duration=1200, task0 will run for 30 minutes,
# followed by task1 for 20 minutes, for a total of 50 minutes.
#
# Example: Use the 'tasks' string below.  Pass 'tasks=tasks' as an argument into
#          job.run_test().
