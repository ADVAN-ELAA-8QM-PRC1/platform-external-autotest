Verify effects of policy_ProxySettings policy on client behavior.

This test verifies the effect of the ProxySettings user policy on Chrome OS
client behavior and appearance. It exercises a range of policy values using
three unique test cases, named: FixedProxy, NotSet, and TBD. See the test file
for a full description of what each test case does.

Usage example:
$ test_that <IPAddress> policy_ProxySettings --args="mode=single
case=FixedProxy nv=dm-test dms_name=xot-dmst
username=test@crosprqa1.com password=test1234"

This command runs a single test case (e.g., FixedProxy) using the specified
test DM Server environment, and signing in with the specified username and
password.
