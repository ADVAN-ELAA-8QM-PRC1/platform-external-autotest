Framework for host verification in Autotest.

The framework provides implementation code in support of
`Host.verify()` used in Verify special tasks.

The framework consists of these classes:
  * `Verifier`: A class representing a single verification check.
  * `RepairStrategy`:  A class for organizing a collection of
    `Verifier` instances, and invoking them in order.

Individual operations during verification are handled by instances of
`Verifier`.  `Verifier` objects are meant to test for specific
conditions that may cause tests to fail.

    to signal that the original failure is further down the dependency

    specially.

class Verifier(object):
    """
    Abstract class embodying one verification check.

    A concrete subclass of `Verifier` provides a simple check that can
    determine a host's fitness for testing.  Failure indicates that the
    check found a problem that can cause at least one test to fail.

    `Verifier` objects are organized in a DAG identifying dependencies
    among operations.  The DAG controls ordering and prevents wasted
    effort:  If verification operation V2 requires that verification
    operation V1 pass, then a) V1 will run before V2, and b) if V1
    fails, V2 won't run at all.  The `_verify_host()` method ensures
    that all dependencies run and pass before invoking the `verify()`
    method.

    A `Verifier` object caches its result the first time it calls
    `verify()`.  Subsequent calls return the cached result, without
    re-running the check code.  The `_reverify()` method clears the
    cached result in the current node, and in all dependencies.

    Subclasses must supply these properties and methods:
      * `verify()`: This is the method to perform the actual
        verification check.
      * `description`:  This is a property with a one-line summary of
        the verification check to be performed.  This string is used to
        identify the verifier in debug logs.
    Subclasses must override all of the above attributes; subclasses
    should not override or extend any other attributes of this class.

    The base class manages the following private data:
      * `_result`:  The cached result of verification.
      * `_dependency_list`:  The list of dependencies.
    Subclasses should not use these attributes.

    @property tag               Short identifier to be used in logging.
    @property description       Text summary of the verification check.
    @property _result           Cached result of verification.

        containing the description of each failed verifier.  Only

        to a failed dependency are omitted.

        By design, original failures are logged once in `_verify_host()`

        Unconditionally perform a verification check.

        This method is responsible for testing for a single problem on a
        host.  Implementations should follow these guidelines:
          * The check should find a problem that will cause testing to
            fail.
          * Verification checks on a working system should run quickly
            and should be optimized for success; a check that passes
            should finish within seconds.
          * Verification checks are not expected have side effects, but
            may apply trivial fixes if they will finish within the time
            constraints above.

        A verification check should normally trigger a single set of
        repair actions.  If two different failures can require two
        different repairs, ideally they should use two different
        subclasses of `Verifier`.

        Implementations indicate failure by raising an exception.  The

        `status.log` files.

class RepairStrategy(object):
    """
    A class for organizing `Verifier` objects.

    An instance of `RepairStrategy` is organized as a DAG of `Verifier`
    objects.  The class provides methods for invoking those objects in
    order, when needed: the `verify()` method walks the verifier DAG in
    dependency order.

    The verifier DAG is constructed from a tuple (or any iterable)
    passed to the `RepairStrategy` constructor.  Each entry is a
    two-element iterable of the form `(constructor, tag, deps)`:
      * The `constructor` value is a callable that creates a `Verifier`
        as for the interface of the default constructor.  For classes
        that inherit the default constructor from `Verifier`, this can
        be the class itself.
      * The `tag` value is the tag to be associated with the constructed
        verifier.
      * The `deps` value is an iterable (e.g. list or tuple) of strings.
        Each string corresponds to the `tag` member of a `Verifier`
        dependency.

    The tag names of verifiers in the constructed DAG must all be
    unique.  The verifier tag name `'PASS'` is reserved and may not be
    used by any verifier.

    In the input data for the constructor, dependencies must appear
    before the nodes that depend on them.  Thus:

        ((A, 'a', ()), (B, 'b', ('a',)))     # This is valid
        ((B, 'b', ('a',)), (A, 'a', ()))     # This will fail!

    Internally, the DAG of verifiers is given unique root node.  So,
    given this input:

        ((C, 'c', ()),
         (A, 'a', ('c',)),
         (B, 'b', ('c',)))

    The following DAG is constructed:

          Root
          /  \
         A    B
          \  /
           C

    Since nothing depends on `A` or `B`, the root node guarantees that
    these two verifiers will both be called and properly logged.

    The root node is not part of the public interface, but it _is_
    logged in `status.log` whenever `verify()` succeeds.
