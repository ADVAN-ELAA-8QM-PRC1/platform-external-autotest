A simple web service used by Buffet to test interactions with a
device server. Implements basic functionality for registration, device commands
and state changes.

To start the test server yourself, run server.py. Otherwise, server.py exposes
start_server/stop_server methods.

To test locally:
./server.py

# Register a device.
curl -X POST -d "" http://localhost:8080/clouddevices/v1/registrationTickets
curl -X PATCH  -d '{"userEmail": "me"}' -H "Authorization: Bearer 1/TEST-ME" \
    http://localhost:8080/clouddevices/v1/registrationTickets/<id>
curl -X POST -d "" \
    http://localhost:8080/clouddevices/v1/registrationTickets/<id>/finalize
