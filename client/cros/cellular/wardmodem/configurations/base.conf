#   Here,
#     - at_command [string] is the AT Command received,

#     - function [string] is a function exported by the state machine mapped to

#     - (idx1, idx2, ...) [tuple of int] Optionally, lists the (int) indices of
#       the arguments that should be passed on from the AT command to the called

#   Example: If the map contains a row {'wm_says_hello': 'AT+Ur0sum=*,*,cats'}
#   Then for wardmodem response ('wm_says_hello', 'my', 2) is interpreted as the

# Format:

#
#   Here,
#     - incoming_at: The incoming AT command to respond to
#     - outgoing_ok: The exact response to be returned, if the machine is
#       enabled. This can be a "string" or a "list of strings".
#       Example: If |outgoing_ok| is ['AT1', 'AT2']. The response sent is:
#       'AT1'
#       'AT2'
#       'OK'
#       Example: If |outgoing_ok| is 'AT1'. The response sent is (no trailing
#       'OK'):
#       'AT1'
#       This mode is required sometimes for responses from the modem that are
#       not followed by an 'OK'.
#
#     - outgoing_error: The exact response to be returned, if the machine is
#       disabled. This may be omitted. In that case, the default ERROR
#       command is returned. If included, it must be of type str.

# Any entry from modem configuration file overrides the entry here.
