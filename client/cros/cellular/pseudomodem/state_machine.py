    StateMachine is the abstract base class for the complex state machines
    that are involved in the pseudo modem manager.

    Every state transition is managed by a function that has been mapped to a
    specific modem state. For example, the method that handles the case where
    the modem is in the ENABLED state would look like:

        def _HandleEnabledState(self):
            # Do stuff.

    The correct method will be dynamically located and executed by the step
    function according to the dictionary returned by the subclass'
    implementation of StateMachine._GetModemStateFunctionMap.
