class ui_TestBase(test.test):
    """ Encapsulates steps needed to collect screenshots for ui pieces.

    Each child class must implement:
    1. Abstract method capture_screenshot()
    Each child class will define its own custom way of capturing the screenshot
    of the piece it cares about.

    E.g Child class ui_SystemTray will capture system tray screenshot,
    ui_SettingsPage for the Chrome Settings page, etc.

    2. Abstract property test_area:
    This will get appended to screenshot file names so we know what image it is,
    it will also get appended to to Biopic project names so that screenshots
    from the same area collect nicely in biopic webview.

    Flow at runtime:
    At run time, autotest will call run_once() method on a particular child
    class object, call it Y.

    Say X is a parent of Y.

    Y.run_once() will save any values passed from control file so as to use them
    later.

    Y.run_once() will then call the parent's X.run_screenshot_comparison_test()

    This is the template algorithm for collecting screenshots.

    Y.run_screenshot_comparison_test will execute its steps. It will then call
    X.test_area to get custom string to use for project name and filename.

     It will execute more steps and then call capture_screenshot(). X doesn't
     implement that, but Y does, so the method will get called on Y to produce
     Y's custom behavior.

     Control will be returned to Y run_screenshot_comparison_test() which will
     execute remainder steps.
