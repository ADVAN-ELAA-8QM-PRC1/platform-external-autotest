This test requires a USB disk plugged-in, which contains a Chrome OS test
image (built by "build_image --test"). In normal mode, this test rollbacks
kernel A and results kernel B boot. It then rollbacks kernel B and
results recovery boot. In developer mode, the firmware ignores kernel
rollback check so it remains unchanged.
