Developer notes:

1. Please contact tgao@chromum.org BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGE to this directory.
   (tgao@ is in the process of rewriting RvR tests)

2. Directory structure and naming convention:
 - control file suffix syntax
   <channel>_<protocol>_<traffic_direction>_<ht_value>
   e.g. "001_tcp_rx_ht40_plus" means
     "001" <-- test on channel 1
     "tcp" <-- test w/ TCP traffic
     "rx"  <-- this is a downstream (AP->DUT) test
     "ht40_plus" <-- channel bandwidth is HT40+
 - each test is triggered by its corresponding control file

3. The main variation from test to test is AP config (e.g. channel) and
   test traffic (UDP or TCP)

4. We are primarily interested in metrics of downstream testing.
