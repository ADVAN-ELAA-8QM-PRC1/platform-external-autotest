This is a special control file used by the autoupdate (AU) test scheduler. It
requires a target update URL be provided in order to run.

The test relies on Autotest to image the machine to the proper base image prior
to execution. The target machine is then imaged to the target version and a
basic smoke test is run to verify functionality.
