This test corrupts both kernel A and B and and checks for recovery boot.

This test requires a USB disk plugged-in, which contains a Chrome OS test
image (built by "build_image --test"). On runtime, this test corrupts
both kernel A and B. On next reboot, the kernel verification fails
and enters recovery mode. This test then checks the success of the
recovery boot.
