# Purpose: This test uses netperf to measure receiving TCP throughput of
# a DUT on an open 802.11n network over 5 GHz band (20MHz-channel),
# with A-MPDU disabled.

# A-MPDU = Aggregation of MAC prototcol data units
# A-MSDU = Aggregation of MAC service data units
# ampdu and amsdu are two types of aggregations performed at PHY level to
# improve user level data rate.
