# Purpose: This test uses netperf to measure receiving TCP throughput of
# a DUT on an open 802.11n network over 5 GHz band (20MHz channel only),
# with RIFS option enabled.

# RIFS = Reduced Inter-Frame Spacing
# rifs is a 802.11n feature which reduces the overhead and increases
# throughput slightly.
