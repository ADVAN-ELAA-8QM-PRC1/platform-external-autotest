# Purpose: This test verifies that DUT can successfuly reassemble fragmented
# packets sent by an AP.

# When fragthreshold is set, packets larger than the threshold are broken up
# by the AP and sent in fragments. DUT needs to reassemble these fragments to
# reconstruct the original packets before processing them.
