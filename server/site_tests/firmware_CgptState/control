This test triggers the CgptState test on client side. In the client
CgptState test, it set kernels A and B with different cgpt states
(priority, tries, successful) and checks their boot results.

The test items and logic are now handled in client. This FAFT test
just handles the reboot logic.
See /usr/local/sbin/firmware/saft/cgpt_state.py for more detail.
