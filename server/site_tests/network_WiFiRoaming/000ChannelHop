# This test run is meant to test AP hopping.  This is a fairly
# simple test and is very "kind" to the DUT, in the sense that
# when we do an AP deconfig, it sends out a DEAUTH, so the DUT
# should be immediately aware that it is time to scan for a new
# AP.  This should be a best-case roaming test.
