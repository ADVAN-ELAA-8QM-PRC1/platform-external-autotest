This test requires a USB disk plugged-in, which contains a Chrome OS test
image (built by "build_image --test"). On runtime, this test first requests
a recovery mode on next boot by setting the crossystem recovery_request
flag. It then triggers recovery mode by unplugging and plugging in the USB
disk and checks success of it.
