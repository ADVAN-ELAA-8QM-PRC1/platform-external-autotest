This test uses servo to simulate lid close and open events while surfing top
sites as ranked by www.alexa.com.

Test has two threads one to manage lid open/close the other to surf to
websites.  The surfing thread allows retries (3) if page failed to load due to
network stack teardown/bringup caused by lid changes.

Test takes ~20min to run with default configuration of 50 lid cycles while
visiting top 50 sites.
