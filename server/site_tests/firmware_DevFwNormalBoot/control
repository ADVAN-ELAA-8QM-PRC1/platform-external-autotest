This test is only meaningful on Alex/ZGB, which contains two different types of
RW firmware: normal and developer firmware. It requires a USB disk plugged-in,
which contains a Chrome OS test image (built by "build_image --test").
On runtime, this test sets developer firmware in A and then corrupts the
firmware in B. It forces to do a normal boot. Going to recovery is expected.
