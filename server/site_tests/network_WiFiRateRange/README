Developer notes:

1. Please contact tgao@chromum.org BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGE to this directory.
   (tgao@ is in the process of rewriting RvR tests)

2. Directory structure and naming convention:
 - each test is specified in the form of a Python dictionary
 - test file name follows syntax
   <channel>_<protocol>_<traffic_direction>_<ht_value>
   e.g. "001_tcp_rx_ht40_plus" means
     "001" <-- test on channel 1
     "tcp" <- test w/ TCP traffic
     "rx"  <- this is a downstream (receive) test
     "ht40_plus" <-- channel bandwidth is HT40+
 - each test is triggered by its corresponding control file
 - control file has name "control.<test_filename>"

3. The main variation from test to test is AP config (e.g. channel)

4. We test for both TCP and UDP and downstream traffic only.
