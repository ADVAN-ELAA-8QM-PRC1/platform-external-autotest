This test verifies that the DUT successfully reconnects to a network in dark
resume after getting disconnected from that network while suspended.
We verify the connectivity status of the DUT on resume by parsing shill logs,
since the delays involved in waking a DUT from suspend using autotest framework
make real-time checks inaccurate.
