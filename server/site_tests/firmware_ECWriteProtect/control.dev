DOC = """
This test starts with RO normal mode and enables EC write protect. Software sync
supposed to write protect the entire EC flash, so we expect the following
write protect flags:
  - wp_gpio_asserted
  - ro_at_boot
  - ro_now
  - all_now
These flags are checked under following situations:
  - Cold reset. RO normal.
  - Cold reset. Two stop.
  - Cold reset by ectool. Two stop.
At the end of the test, write protect is deactivated and firmware is restored to
RO normal mode.
