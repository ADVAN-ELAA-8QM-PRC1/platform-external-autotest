WiFiMatFunc is a suite of 3-machine tests to validate basic WiFi functionality.
One client, one server, and one programmable WiFi AP/Router are required
(either off-the-shelf with a network-accesible CLI or a Linux/BSD system
with a WiFi card that supports HostAP functionality).

Configuration information to run_test:

server     - the IP address of the server (automatically filled in)
client     - the IP address of the client (automatically filled in)
router     - the IP address of the WiFi AP/Router and the names of the
			 wifi and wired devices to configure
