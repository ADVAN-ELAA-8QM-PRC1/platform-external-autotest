with a WiFi card that supports HostAP functionality).

Configuration information to run_test:

server     - the IP address of the server (automatically filled in)
client     - the IP address of the client (automatically filled in)
router     - the IP address of the WiFi AP/Router and the names of the
             wifi and wired devices to configure
