# Connect to a WPA AP using TKIP for pairwise encryption key management.
# TODO(pstew):
# This is the first WPA case in the test suite.  It is possible under
# certain conditions that the AP system has not achieved enough randomness
# at startup time, so start with a negative test.  It would be better if
# we addressed the issue of running out of randomness in some other form.
