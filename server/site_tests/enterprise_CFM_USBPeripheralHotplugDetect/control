This test clears the TPM if necessary, kicks off a client side test that enrolls
a device as a hotrod device and hotplugs USB peripherals. After hotplug, it
checks and verifies that both CrOS and Hotrod see the same set of Audio / Video
peripherals. Clears the TPM again before test exits.

Test relies on JMI logs to be made available on the device under test. Once the
device is enrolled and OOBE is detected, webrtc should start creating JMI data
and save a copy of this data log in the /tmp directory.
