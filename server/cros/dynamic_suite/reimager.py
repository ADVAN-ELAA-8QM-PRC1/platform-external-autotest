        Unfortunately, we can't rely on the scheduler to pick hosts for
        us when using dependencies.  The problem is that the scheduler
        treats all host queue entries as independent, and isn't capable
        of looking across a set of entries to make intelligent decisions
        about which hosts to use.  Consider a testbed that has only one
        'bluetooth'-labeled device, and a set of tests in which some
        require bluetooth and some could run on any machine.  If we
        schedule two reimaging jobs, one of which states that it should
        run on a bluetooth-having machine, the scheduler may choose to
        run the _other_ reimaging job (which has fewer constraints)
        on the DUT with the 'bluetooth' label -- thus starving the first
        reimaging job.  We can't schedule a single job with heterogeneous
        dependencies, either, as that is unsupported and devolves to the
        same problem: the scheduler is not designed to make decisions
        across multiple host queue entries.
