This directory includes openocd scripts copied from
git://chromium.googlesource.com/git/chromiumos/platform/ec:chip/lm4/openocd (sha1
52440ef8). The scripts are necessary for programming Chrome OS EC on x86
platforms.

These scripts are not likely to change often - mostly with major openocd
changes or adding some new hardware. There is a chance that this directory
will get out of sync with the source.

A tracking issue (http://crosbug.com/37572) was created to highlight this
problem and attempt to resolve it.
