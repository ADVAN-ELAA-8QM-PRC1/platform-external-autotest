"""CrOS dynamic test suite generation and execution module.

This module implements runtime-generated test suites for CrOS.
Design doc: http://goto.google.com/suitesv2

Individual tests can declare themselves as a part of one or more
suites, and the code here enables control files to be written
that can refer to these "dynamic suites" by name.  We also provide
support for reimaging devices with a given build and running a
dynamic suite across all reimaged devices.

The public API for defining a suite includes one method: reimage_and_run().
A suite control file can be written by importing this module and making
an appropriate call to this single method.  In normal usage, this control
file will be run in a 'hostless' server-side autotest job, scheduling
sub-jobs to do the needed reimaging and test running.

Example control file:

import common
from autotest_lib.server.cros import dynamic_suite

dynamic_suite.reimage_and_run(
    build=build, board=board, name='bvt', job=job, pool=pool,
    check_hosts=check_hosts, add_experimental=True, num=num,
    skip_reimage=dynamic_suite.skip_reimage(globals()))

This will -- at runtime -- find all control files that contain "bvt"
in their "SUITE=" clause, schedule jobs to reimage |num| devices in the
specified pool of the specified board with the specified build and,
upon completion of those jobs, schedule and wait for jobs that run all
the tests it discovered across those |num| machines.

Suites can be run by using the atest command-line tool:
  atest suite create -b <board> -i <build/name> <suite>
e.g.
  atest suite create -b x86-mario -i x86-mario/R20-2203.0.0 bvt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation details

In addition to the create_suite_job() RPC defined in the autotest frontend,
there are two main classes defined here: Suite and Reimager.

A Suite instance represents a single test suite, defined by some predicate
run over all known control files.  The simplest example is creating a Suite
by 'name'.

The Reimager class provides support for reimaging a heterogenous set
of devices with an appropriate build, in preparation for a test run.
One could use a single Reimager, followed by the instantiation and use
of multiple Suite objects.

create_suite_job() takes the parameters needed to define a suite run (board,
build to test, machine pool, and which suite to run), ensures important
preconditions are met, finds the appropraite suite control file, and then
schedules the hostless job that will do the rest of the work.

reimage_and_run() works by creating a Reimager, using it to perform the
requested installs, and then instantiating a Suite and running it on the
machines that were just reimaged.  We'll go through this process in stages.

Note that we have more than one Dev server in our test lab architecture.
We currently load balance per-build being tested, so one and only one dev
server is used by any given run through the reimaging/testing flow.

- create_suite_job()
The primary role of create_suite_job() is to ensure that the required
artifacts for the build to be tested are staged on the dev server.  This
includes payloads required to autoupdate machines to the desired build, as
well as the autotest control files appropriate for that build.  Then, the
RPC pulls the control file for the suite to be run from the dev server and
uses it to create the suite job with the autotest frontend.

                                                      Suite Job (hostless)

- The Reimaging process
In short, the Reimager schedules and waits for a number of autoupdate 'test'
jobs that perform image installation and make sure the device comes back up.
It labels the machines that it reimages with the newly-installed CrOS version,
so that later steps in the can refer to the machines by version and board,
instead of having to keep track of hostnames or some such.  Furthermore, these
machines are 'Locked' in the AFE as soon as they have started to go through
reimaging.  They will be unlocked as soon as the suite's actual test jobs
have been scheduled against them.  This is to avoid races between different
suites trying to grab machines at the same time.

The number of machines to use is called the 'sharding_factor', and the default
is defined in the [CROS] section of global_config.ini.  This can be overridden
by passing a 'num=N' parameter to create_suite_job(), which is piped through
to reimage_and_run() just like the 'build' and 'board' parameters are.

Step by step:
1) Schedule autoupdate 'tests' across N devices of the appropriate board.
  - Technically, one job that has N tests across N hosts.
  - This 'test' is in server/site_tests/autoupdate/
  - The control file is modified at runtime to inject the name of the build
    to install, and the URL to get said build from.
  - This is the _TOT_ version of the autoupdate test; it must be able to run
    successfully on all currently supported branches at all times.
2) Wait for this job to get kicked off.
3) As each host is chosen by the scheduler and begins reimaging, lock it.
4) Wait for all reimaging to run to completion.
5) Label successfully reimaged devices with a 'cros-version' label
  - This is actually done by the autoupdate 'test' control file.
6) Add a host attribute ('job_repo_url') to each reimaged host indicating
   the URL where packages should be downloaded for subsequent tests
  - This is actually done by the autoupdate 'test' control file
  - This information is consumed in server/site_autotest.py
  - job_repo_url points to some location on the dev server, where build
    artifacts are staged -- including autotest packages.
7) Return success or failure.

                                          host-attribute

To sum up, after re-imaging, we have the following assumptions:
- |num| devices of type |board| have |build| installed.
- These devices are labeled appropriately
- They have a host attribute called 'job_repo_url' dictating where autotest
  packages can be downloaded for test runs.


- Running Suites
A Suite instance uses the labels created by the Reimager to schedule test jobs
across all the hosts that were just reimaged.  It then waits for all these jobs.
As an optimization, the Dev server stages the payloads necessary to run a suite
in the background _after_ it has completed all the things necessary for
reimaging.  Before running a suite, reimage_and_run() calls out to the Dev
server and blocks until it's completed staging all build artifacts needed to
run test suites.

Step by step:
1) At instantiation time, find all appropriate control files for this suite
   that were included in the build to be tested.  To do this, we consult the
   Dev Server, where all these control files are staged.

          +------------+    control files?     +--------------------------+
          |            |<----------------------|                          |
          | Dev Server |                       | Autotest Frontend (AFE)  |
          |            |---------------------->|       [Suite Job]        |
          +------------+    control files!     +--------------------------+

2) Now that the Suite instance exists, it schedules jobs for every control
   file it deemed appropriate, to be run on the hosts that were labeled
   by the Reimager.  We stuff keyvals into these jobs, indicating what
   build they were testing and which suite they were for.

   +--------------------------+ Job for VersLabel       +--------+
   |                          |------------------------>| Host 1 | VersLabel
   | Autotest Frontend (AFE)  |            +--------+   +--------+
   |       [Suite Job]        |----------->| Host 2 |
   +--------------------------+ Job for    +--------+
       |                ^       VersLabel        VersLabel
       |                |
       +----------------+
        One job per test
        {'build': build/name,
         'suite': suite_name}

3) Now that all jobs are scheduled, they'll be doled out as labeled hosts
   finish their assigned work and become available again.
4) As we clean up each job, we check to see if any crashes occurred.  If they
   did, we look at the 'build' keyval in the job to see which build's debug
   symbols we'll need to symbolicate the crash dump we just found.
5) Using this info, we tell a special Crash Server to stage the required debug
   symbols. Once that's done, we ask the Crash Server to use those symbols to
   symbolicate the crash dump in question.

     +----------------+
     | Google Storage |
     +----------------+
          |     ^
 symbols! |     | symbols?
          V     |
      +------------+  stage symbols for build  +--------------------------+
      |            |<--------------------------|                          |
      |   Crash    |                           |                          |
      |   Server   |   dump to symbolicate     | Autotest Frontend (AFE)  |
      |            |<--------------------------|       [Suite Job]        |
      |            |-------------------------->|                          |
      +------------+    symbolicated dump      +--------------------------+

6) As jobs finish, we record their success or failure in the status of the suite
   job.  We also record a 'job keyval' in the suite job for each test, noting
   the job ID and job owner.  This can be used to refer to test logs later.
7) Once all jobs are complete, status is recorded for the suite job, and the
   job_repo_url host attribute is removed from all hosts used by the suite.
