"""
Automatically update the afe_stable_versions table.

This command updates the stable repair version for selected boards
in the lab.  For each board, if the version that Omaha is serving
on the Beta channel for the board is more recent than the current
stable version in the AFE database, then the AFE is updated to use
the version on Omaha.

The upgrade process is applied to every "managed board" in the test
lab.  Generally, a managed board is a board with both spare and
critical scheduling pools.

See `autotest_lib.site_utils.lab_inventory` for the full definition
of "managed board".

The command supports a `--dry-run` option that reports changes that
would be made, without making the actual RPC calls to change the
database.

    This class is responsible for the low-level logic of applying

     1. To distinguish "normal" vs. "dry-run" modes.  Each mode has a

        implemented for the normal mode subclass only.

        the reporting and modification behaviors, in order to test the
        higher level logic that decides what changes are needed.

    starting with "report" or "_report".  Methods that are meant to
    change the AFE in normal mode have names starting with "_do"
